Title: Implement AlertCreationScreen UI

Description:
Implement the Alert creation user interface for the data entry role. This should be a simple page/screen that collects: ticker symbol, target price, condition (above/below), and notification methods (email/SMS/push). Choose a lightweight stack (plain HTML/JS or JavaFX/Swing based on course requirements).

Acceptance Criteria:
- UI screen displays labeled input fields for ticker, target price, condition, and notification methods.
- Validation: ticker is non-empty, target price is positive, at least one notification method selected.
- "Create Alert" button submits the form and shows a confirmation message with the created alert details.
- The screen can be manually tested locally.
